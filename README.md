# My Projects

This repository is a simple culmination of all of my personal projects and course assignments. These are simple things from learning how to program in Bash to current projects in my classes.

## Running Code

### Python

All code was developed using Python 2.7. You may run it using the `Python example.py` command.

### C++

All code was developed according to the C++ 2011 standard. Pretty much all assignments and recitation activities should have a “main.out” or other primary executable file to see the activity run. If you want to compile it from scratch, you may use:
* `g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp` for non CodeBlocks projects.
* `g++ -std=c++11 -I include/ src/*.cpp *.cpp` for CodeBlocks projects.

## About the Author
